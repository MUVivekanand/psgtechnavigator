Below are several sample user questions related to the MongoDB document provided, 
and the corresponding MongoDB aggregation pipeline queries that can be used to fetch the desired data.
Use them wisely.

Question 1:Where is CSE department located? 

Query:
json
[
  { "$match": { "deptavailable": "CSE" } },
  { "$project": { "title": 1, "description": 1, "_id": 0 } }
]


Question 2:What are the departments available in E-Block? 

Query:
json
[
  { "$match": { "title": "E-Block" } },
  { "$project": { "deptavailable": 1, "_id": 0 } }
]


Question 3:Which block is the main canteen located? 
json
[
  { "$match": { "description": { "$regex": "canteen", "$options": "i" } } },
  { "$project": { "title": 1, "_id": 0 } }
]


Question 4:List all the available blocks of PSG Tech.

Query:

[
  { "$project": { "title": 1, "_id": 0 } }

Each of these queries is designed to run within MongoDB's aggregation framework to extract specific information based on the user's questions.
The `$project` step is used to format the output to include only relevant fields.
